#### Continue to study and ponder to improve the code structure.

This project is to make template code that can be applied to any app development.
It is written based on JavaScript, and when the JavaScript-based template source code structure is completed, a TypeScript-based source code will also be created.

- Language: Javascript

#### How To Setup Environment

It's mandantory to set up the development environment and build the app by following the instructions below:

> Visit https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
> Install Node, Brew, Yarn, Npm etc packages
> npx react-native init react_native --version 0.68.2
> Set-up Android SDK path
> pod install
> Open iOS app project with Xcode IDE
> Set-up Bundle Identifier & Team account
> Build Clean + Re-build
> Set-up iOS device name in package.json
> rm -rf /Users/admin/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
> pod deintegrate
> pod install
> Clean & Re-build ios project
> Set-up Team account about Cocoapods AccessibilityReources
> npx react-native run-ios
> brew install ruby
> sudo gem install fastlane
> sudo gem install bundler
> bundle init
> Write 'gem "fastlane"' to Gemfile
> cd ios
> fastlane init

#### BLE Configuration

Define the BLE uuid and other values you want in the BleConfig.js file below.

```sh
export const SERVICE_UUID = ''

export const RX_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = ''
export const TX_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = ''
export const FLOW_CONTROL_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = ''

export const BATTERY_SERVICE_UUID = ''
export const BATTERY_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = ''

export const BLE_TEST_MODE = false
export const BLE_TEST_DEVICE_NAME = ""
export const BLE_TEST_DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS = ""

export const BLE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_INDEX = 0

export const BLE_PAIRING_VERSION = 0
export const BLE_PAIRING_RESULT_INDEX = 0
export const BLE_PAIRING_RESULT_SUCCESS = 0

export const BLE_NOTIFICATION_SUFFIX = 0
export const BLE_STATUS_INFO_SUFFIX = 0
```

#### Source Code

From UI To Core Module.

UI JSX Element.

```sh
return (
    <BluetoothComponent
        bleConnectionState={bleConnectionState}
        bleConnectionCompleteState={bleConnectionCompleteState}
    />
)
```

UseCase.

```sh
executeStartScanUseCase().catch((e) => {
    outputErrorLog(LOG_TAG, e + " occurred by executeStartScanUseCase")
})
```

Repository.

```sh
 const {
    connectDevice, disableNotification, disconnectDevice, enableNotification,
    initializeBleModule, getUuidList, sendBleCustomData, startScan, stopScan,
    getBleDeviceInfo
 } = BleRepository()

 executeStartScanUseCase = (serviceUuid = SERVICE_UUID, duration = SCAN_DURATION) => {
    return new Promise((fulfill, reject) => {
        startScan(serviceUuid, duration).then(() => {
            fulfill()
        }).catch((e) => {
            reject(e)
        })
    })
}

this.enableBluetooth().then(() => {
    bleManager.scan(serviceUuids, duration, false).then(() => {
        fulfill()
    }).catch((e) => {
        reject(e)
    })
}).catch((e) => {
    reject(e)
})
```

State Management.

```sh
const setBleScanningStateAtom = useSetRecoilState(bleScanningStateAtom)
const bleScanningState = useRecoilValue(bleScanningStateAtom)
```
