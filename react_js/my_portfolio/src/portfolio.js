    "I'm a responsible person. As a senior developer based on Android, Kotlin, I have implemented various ui apps and services in Mobile, OTT, and IoT environments. I think that development should be done to contribute to the company's goals rather than focusing on what an individual wants, so I always think about source code design to build a good structure and quick development at the start of a project. And I always go over new skills in order to respond promptly to changes in the development direction of a company or team. Currently, I've been developing Android, Cross-Platform Mobile App, and Web Front-End based on React and Flutter.",
